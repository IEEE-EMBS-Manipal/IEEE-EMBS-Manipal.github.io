    <h2>Research and Project Wing</h2>
    <p>The Research & Project Wing has been split into five subsystems for effective streamlining of our activities:</p>
    <h3>1.Subsystem of Electronics & Hardware: </h3>
    <p>This subsystem is responsible for the inner working of the electrical and electronic hardware components of medical devices.
       These can include fundamental electrical components to working with microcontrollers and microprocessors. The scope of this 
       subsystem ranges from instrumentation to imaging. Members will use software like LTSpice, PSpice, Proteus, Âµvision and machine 
       level coding on microcontrollers & microprocessors.</p>
    <h3>2.Subsystem of Signal & Image Processing:</h3>
    <p>This subsystem is responsible for the synthesis of 1D signals (audio, EEG, EMG, ECG)
        and 2D signals (conventional RBG images, microscopic blood smears, ultrasound,
        doppler, CT, MRI). Members will use MATLAB & Python.</p>
    <h3>3.Subsystem of Artificial Intelligence:</h3>
    <p>This subsystem will apply concepts of pattern recognition and data science to
        synthesize digital data of all forms: tabular, 1D signals, images & videos.
        Members will make use of Machine & Deep Learning along with tools in Data
        Science on the platforms of MATLAB & Simulink, Python and RStudio.</p>
    <h3>4.Subsystem of Clinical Sciences:</h3>
    <p>This subsystem will be responsible for bridging the aforementioned three engineering
        subsystems with the biological functioning of the human body. Members will work
        in tandem with health professionals to better understand the anatomical and
        physiological aspects of the problems that biomedical engineering aims to
        solve.</p>
    <h3>5.Subsystem of Industry Analysis:</h3>
    <p>This subsystem will analyze the commercial aspect of the medical technologies
       industry and the market it serves. The aim of this subsystem is to inform the
       other technical subsystem about underserved areas of the industry and the 
       commercial side of getting a project in the medical technology industry in the hands of users.
       Members will use Microsoft Excel, Tableau and elements of data science with
       RStudio.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Content & Program Wing</h2>
    <p>The Content & Program Wing has been split into three subsystems:</p>
    <h3>1.Content</h3>
    <p>The Content Wing manages the the blog, newsletter and posts for the social media 
        handles. The wing is further split into the Editorial Committee and the Graphics
        & Design Committee. Members of the content wing will use software like Canva, Inkscape,
        Adobe Illustrator, WordPress & Medium.</p>
    <h3>2.Marketing & Public Relations</h3>
    <p>Members interested in the Program wing can work in the Marketing & Public Relations
        committee. This committee will promote the activities, events & workshops
        held via social medial strategies to have the maximum reach possible. They will
        also be responsible for handling membership drives and the LinkedIn &
        Instagram handles.</p>
    <h3>3.IT & Web Development </h3>
    <p>Interested members of IT & Web Development Committee will supervise and maintain the technological integrations used, such
        as Linux, GitHub, Google Workspace, Office 365, Discord server etc. They will
        also support the other subsystems with technological know-how of these
        software. Members will work on Linux (bash scripting), open-source software and
        most importantly, web development with HTML, CSS & JavaScript among other
        skills to become effective system admins.</p>
