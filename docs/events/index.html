            <p class="card-text reveal-on-scroll">This was a live webinar on understanding computational approaches for brain imaging analysis and tDCS effects in psychiatry given by Dr Gaurav Bhalerao, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford. The event started with Tushar Nayak, the chair of IEEE EMBS Manipal, welcoming everyone to the webinar and introducing Dr Gaurav Bhalerao to the attendees. Dr Gaurav Bhalerao began his talk by discussing the topics that interest him in the research field, which include Neuroimaging to Computer-aided diagnosis and his work with notable publications in his years of research. He further talks about his ongoing work at the University of Oxford. He speaks about the necessity of mental health literacy and gives examples of brain disorders and different modalities to study brain activity. Dr Gaurav goes into detail about MRI and explains different types of MRI modalities and different artefacts in MRI images. He analyzes various atlases that can be used for visualization. He listed the types of data formats in the imaging tools store and elaborated on the conversion between these different data formats. Next, he showed demos on MRI visualization using software tools such as MRIcron and MRIcroGL and Tissue segmentation using the Machine learning toolbox on MATLAB. He further gave some valuable Machine-learning tips, including the importance of data cleaning and cross-validation. He elaborated on tDCS, its protocol and modelling. He ended the talk by giving the attendees related exciting topics to work with and telling them about the future scope of this field. The webinar concluded with answering questions from the participants.</p>
